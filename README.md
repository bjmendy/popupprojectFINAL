• I originally wanted this to be able to have an image input, but with ruby and sql it is the HARDEST thing to do.

• There are entire frameworks dedicated to doing so, and if I had, I would've created Instagram. 

• I wanted it to be really clean and minimal so I could work on it outside of the one week we had. I'm still having a lot of trouble with Ruby, React and SQL.

• I wanted a simple, clean project I could expand on. I tried creating a hyperlink out of the .link property, but it wouldn't take.

• I want to eventually have it show a link or be able to upload a photo.

• I would also like to implement a function that will NOT let someone post the same input twice.

• I want to make the input look cleaner, but putting in an actual date in the date input messes with the SQL.

• I used HTML (Rails), CSS, LESS, SQL, Ruby and Animate.CSS.
